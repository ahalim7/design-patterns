Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct objects but 
leaves the actual object creation to concrete factory classes. 
Each factory type corresponds to a certain object variety.


Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of 
related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of 
those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow 
for future extensibility.
