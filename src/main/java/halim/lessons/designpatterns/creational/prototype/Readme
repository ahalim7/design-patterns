Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects 
without making your code dependent on their classes.


An object that supports cloning is called a prototype. 
When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, 
cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing. Here’s how it works: 
you create a set of objects, configured in various ways. 
When you need an object like the one you’ve configured, 
you just clone a prototype instead of constructing a new object from scratch.
